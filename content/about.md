## Who Are You?
My name is Justin, but most people call me Juice.  I am a software engineer who loves to cook, boulder, travel, and take on too many ambitious projects at the same time...

## What Is This?
A place for me to organize and share my thoughts and progress.

## Why Build This?
Originally, I wanted to start keeping track of my cooking journey and recipes that I have created or modified and have a place to share my progress.    

But at the same time I also started my journey in learning Japanese.  So instead of making a food only blog I wanted to create a space where I can share my thoughts and share my journey(s) of my many at home projects.  

My hope is that having a place to put my thoughts and keep track of my progress to help me progress and actually finish some of my projects.
